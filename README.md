# node-red-contrib-discord-many-nodes

## Install

Clone this repository into a folder of your choice. In this example I cloned it into the `~/` folder.

Change dir to `~/.node-red`.

```
cd ~/.node-red
```

Install this package with the command

```
npm install ~/node-red-contrib-discord-many-nodes
```

This will create a symbolic link to the node module project directory in `~/.node-red`. Node-RED will discover the node when it starts.

Now Restart Node-RED:

```
node-red-restart
```
